# Schema Notes

Reference for developers working on the ResumeAI data layer.

## Model relationships

```
User
 ├── Resume[]            (one user, many resumes)
 │    ├── JobApplication[]   (a resume can be used across many applications)
 │    └── AutoApplyCampaign[] (a campaign is pinned to one resume at creation)
 ├── JobApplication[]    (direct link for manual/one-off applications)
 └── AutoApplyCampaign[] (a user can run several campaigns in parallel)

JobApplication
 └── ApplicationEvent[]  (immutable audit trail: submitted, viewed, interview_requested …)

AutoApplyCampaign
 └── JobApplication[]    (all applications spawned by this campaign)
```

## Why `linkedinPasswordEnc` lives on `AutoApplyCampaign`, not `User`

A single ResumeAI user can operate **multiple LinkedIn accounts simultaneously** — for
example a recruiter managing candidates, or a job-seeker who wants to separate their
"English CV" campaign from their "German CV" campaign with a different regional LinkedIn
profile.

Storing credentials on `User` would enforce a one-to-one constraint that the product
does not impose.  Storing them on the campaign keeps each set of credentials scoped to
its purpose and means revoking one campaign never affects another.

**Encryption:** `linkedinPasswordEnc` is Fernet-encrypted at the application layer using
`ENCRYPTION_KEY` before write, and decrypted on read inside the worker.  The DB stores
only ciphertext — a DB dump alone cannot recover credentials.

## Legacy field mapping

Every column from the old SQLite databases is accounted for below.  The migration
script in `scripts/migrate-from-legacy.ts` (Prompt 8) uses this table as its source of
truth.

### `bot.db`.`users` → `User`

| Legacy column | New field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `telegram_id` | `legacyId` | Stored as `Int?`; used as join key during migration |
| `username` | `telegramUsername` | Telegram @handle, nullable |
| `full_name` | `name` | Already on User |
| `referral_code` | — | Feature cut; not carried forward |
| `referred_by` | — | Feature cut |
| `credits_balance` | `credits` | Already on User |
| `total_resumes_generated` | `usageCount` | Seeded during migration |
| `total_assistant_messages` | `UsageRecord` rows | Written as feature=`assistant_message` |
| `total_spent_rub` | `Invoice` rows | Written as historical invoices in RUB |
| `created_at` | `createdAt` | |
| `last_active` | `lastActiveAt` | |

### `autoapply.db`.`autoapply_users` → `User` + `AutoApplyCampaign`

| Legacy column | New field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `telegram_id` | `legacyId` | Join key (same as bot.db) |
| `email` | `email` | Already on User |
| `password_hash` | — | Legacy bcrypt hash; users re-auth via magic link |
| `plan` | `stripePriceId` | Mapped to Stripe price during migration |
| `daily_limit` | `dailyApplicationLimit` on User | Plan-level default |
| `applications_today` | — | Derived at runtime from `JobApplication.appliedAt` |
| `applications_total` | `usageCount` (merged) | |
| `responses_received` | — | Derived from `ApplicationEvent` of type `interview_requested` |
| `linkedin_email` | `AutoApplyCampaign.linkedinEmail` | Per-campaign |
| `linkedin_password_enc` | `AutoApplyCampaign.linkedinPasswordEnc` | Per-campaign, Fernet |
| `hh_token` | — | hh.ru integration was cut; `AutoApplyCampaign.hhToken` dropped in migration `20260524100000_remove_hh_ru_legacy_columns` |
| `hh_resume_id` | — | Same — `AutoApplyCampaign.hhResumeId` dropped in same migration |
| `resume_text` | `Resume.generated` | Imported as `{ legacy: true, text: "..." }` |
| `is_verified` | `emailVerified` on User | |
| `consent_at` | `Consent` row | Written as type=`tos`, version=`legacy` |
| `stripe_customer_id` | `stripeCustomerId` | |

### `autoapply.db`.`campaigns` → `AutoApplyCampaign`

| Legacy column | New field |
|---|---|
| `job_title` | `name` (campaign name) + `keywords[0]` |
| `location` | `locations[]` |
| `salary_min` | `salaryMin` |
| `experience` | `experience` |
| `platforms` | `source` (enum) |
| `daily_limit` | `dailyLimit` |
| `status` | `isActive` (active/paused → boolean) |
| `applications_sent` | `totalSent` |
| `responses` | `responsesCount` |
| `last_run` | `lastRunAt` |

### `autoapply.db`.`applications` → `JobApplication`

| Legacy column | New field |
|---|---|
| `platform` | `source` (enum) |
| `vacancy_id` | `vacancyId` |
| `vacancy_title` | `jobTitle` |
| `company_name` | `company` |
| `vacancy_url` | `jobUrl` |
| `resume_used` | `resumeId` (FK resolved by matching `Resume.generated.legacy`) |
| `status` | `status` (enum) |
| `sent_at` | `appliedAt` |
| `response_at` | `responseAt` |

### `autoapply.db`.`vacancies_cache` → `JobListing`

| Legacy column | New field |
|---|---|
| `platform` | `source` (enum) |
| `vacancy_id` | `externalId` |
| `title` | `title` |
| `company` | `company` |
| `location` | `location` |
| `salary` | `salary` (free-form text) |
| `description` | `description` |
| `url` | `url` |
| `fetched_at` | `scrapedAt` |
| `applied` | `applied` |

## Enum values

### `JobSource`
`LINKEDIN` · `CAREEROPS` · `ADZUNA` · `ARBEITNOW` · `REMOTEOK` · `THEMUSE` · `MANUAL`

Legacy `platforms` column used string tags (`linkedin`, `hh`).  HeadHunter maps to
`CAREEROPS` for now; a dedicated `HH` value can be added in a follow-up migration.

### `ApplicationStatus`
`QUEUED` → `SUBMITTED` → (`INTERVIEW` | `REJECTED` | `OFFER` | `WITHDRAWN`)  
`FAILED` is a terminal state for technical failures (bot crash, captcha, etc.).
